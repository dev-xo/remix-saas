# Scripts

Remix SaaS comes with a few scripts that can help you manage your application. We opted for a simple setup, with a few scripts that cover the most common tasks. Scripts are defined in the `package.json` file, under the `scripts` key.

## Available Scripts

- `build`: Builds the application for production.
- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Lints the application (ESLint).
- `typecheck`: Typechecks the application.
- `format`: Formats the application (Prettier).
- `test`: Runs the tests.
- `test:coverage`: Generates a coverage report.

## How to run a script?

To run a script, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run <script-name>
```

For example, to start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
