# Subscriptions

Remix SaaS comes with a simple Subscription System built with Stripe. It includes the following features:

- Subscription Plans
- Subscription Checkout
- Subscription Management (via Stripe Customer Portal)
- Subscription Webhooks

## How does Subscriptions work in Remix SaaS?

First of all, you'll need to create a Stripe Account and get your API Keys. This has been documented in the [Environment](https://github.com/dev-xo/remix-saas/tree/main/docs#environment) section.

Remix SaaS defines a few Subscription Plans in the `/modules/stripe/plans` file. You can customize these plans to fit your needs.

- Remember to migrate your database to seed the plans or any other changes you've made.

In order to use the Subscription System, Remix SaaS will create a Customer in Stripe and subscribe it to a Free Plan by default.

- Customers are created after the Onboarding process is completed.

Free Plans are also canceled by default once the Customer has decided to upgrade to a Paid Plan.
