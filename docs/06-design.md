## Design & User Interface

Remix SaaS comes up with a modern, clean and responsive design. It is built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a design system that provides a set of components and utilities to help you build your application with ease.

### Design System

The main principle was to keep the design as simple as possible, as in the end, everyone will have their own design preferences.

Some other principles that were followed are:

- **Responsive**: The design is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- **Accessible**: The design is accessible, following the best practices for accessibility.
- **Customizable**: The design is customizable, allowing you to change the colors, typography, and other design elements.

### Components

Components and related UI elements are defined in the `/components` directory. Some of the components that are available are:

- `Header`: The application header, provides a set of descriptions based on the current route.
- `Navigation`: The application navigation, provides a set of links to navigate through the application.
- `Toaster`: A toast notification system, provides a way to display messages to the user.

The `ui` folder is `shadcn/ui` design system, which provides a set of components and utilities to help you build your application with ease.

The `misc` folder contains miscellaneous components that are used throughout the application, such as `ErrorBoundary` and `LanguageSwitcher` among others.

### Styles

You can customize the design by editing the styles in the `root.css` file.

- Importing [`shadcn/themes`](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) is a good starting point to customize the initial design.
