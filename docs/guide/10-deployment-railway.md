# Welcome to Remix SaaS Deployment Documentation

If you are new to [Railway](https://railway.com), please check the [Getting Started](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) guide to have a better understanding of the platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your Prisma Migrations will be required in order to deploy the app. Also, Stripe Test Data should be cleaned (Only for development purposes).

## Stripe Webhook - Production

To get started, we'll require to get our Stripe Production Webhook API Key. This key will be required to set up the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` variable in our `.env` file.

1. Visit the [Stripe Webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) section.
2. Create a new Webhook Endpoint.
3. Set the name of your future deployed app as the Webhook URL input. _(Check Notes)_
4. Select the latest Stripe API version from `API version` selector.
5. Select the following events to listen on: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`.
6. Add the Endpoint and reveal the `Signing Secret` value that has been provided from Stripe Webhook page.
7. Set this new secret as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` variable into your `.env` file.

> [!NOTE]
> Example of a Deployed Webhook Endpoint URL: https://deployed-app.fly.dev/api/webhook

Done! Now we can start receiving Stripe Events to your deployed app.
