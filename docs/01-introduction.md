# Introduction to Remix SaaS

Simple introduction to Remix SaaS.

## What is Remix SaaS?

Remix SaaS is a Starter Kit that aims to help you to kickstart your next SaaS project.

Built with [Remix](https://remix.run), on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), Remix SaaS provides a solid foundation for building a SaaS application with features like:

- Authentication (Email/Code, Magic Links, and Socials)
- Subscriptions (Stripe)
- Roles and Permissions (Admin, User, etc.)
- Security Features (CSP, etc.)
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Custom Emails (Authentication and Subscriptions)

And a few more features that will help you to get started with your next project.

## What Remix SaaS is not?

Remix SaaS is not a full-fledged SaaS application, it's a Starter Kit that will help you kickstart your next project. It does not include specific examples on how to build a SaaS application, but it provides a solid foundation to start building your own.

Remix SaaS is not a replacement for [Epic Stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack), [Blues/Indie/Grounge Stacks](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/templates#stacks), [Supa Stripe Stack](https://github.com/rphlmr/supa-stripe-stack) or any other Open-Source Remix Templates.

- Instead, it's a free resource you can use, in the same way you can use any other Remix Template/Resource.

## Who is Remix SaaS for?

- Remix SaaS is for developers who want to build a SaaS application with a modern stack (Remix, Vite, etc.)
- Remix SaaS is for developers who want to build a SaaS application with a solid, lightweight foundation, but don't want to start from scratch.
- Remix SaaS is for developers who already have experience with Remix, Stripe, and other technologies used in the Remix community.

## Will Remix SaaS be maintained?

Remix SaaS is an Open Source project, and it will be maintained as long as there's interest in it. If you want to help maintain Remix SaaS, feel free to contribute to the project.

Your contribution will be more than welcome!

## History & Acknowledgements

Remix SaaS is part of a previous Stack called `Stripe-Stack`, one of the first Remix contributions I've made to the community. It was a simple project that helped me understand how Remix works and how to build a SaaS application with it.

With newly Remix additions, the initial Stack was left behind _(due to the lack of time to maintain it)_, and I always wanted to bring it back to life with new features and improvements.

- Remix SaaS still Stripe Stack, but with a few new features, design, structural improvements, and a new brand.

### Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to [@mw10013](https://github.com/mw10013) who nowadays is my partner in other Remix related project, and who helped build a big part of the new Stack, in the same way he helped with [`remix-auth-totp`](https://github.com/dev-xo/remix-auth-totp).

With this said, I hope you enjoy Remix SaaS and hope it helps you to kickstart your next SaaS project! ❤️
