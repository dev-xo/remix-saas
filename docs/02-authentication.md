# Authentication

This document will guide you through the Authentication process of Remix SaaS.

## How does Authentication work in Remix SaaS?

Remix SaaS provides a simple and secure way to authenticate your users with the following methods:

- Email/Code
- Magic Links
- Social Logins (Github)

Under the hood, we are using `remix-auth`, `remix-auth-totp` and `remix-auth-github` to handle the authentication process.

In order to speed up development, the OTP code will also be displayed in the terminal/console, so you don't have to constantly check the email inbox. (Recommended for development purposes only.)

- You can update/remove this behavior by removing the `console.log()` from `/modules/auth/auth.server.ts` file.

## Email/Code & Magic Links

Email authentication, either by code or magic links, is a common way to authenticate users in web applications. Remix SaaS provides a simple way to authenticate users with their email address.

We are using [Resend](https://resend.com) to send emails to users. Resend is a simple email service for developers that allows you to send emails from your app.

- You can get your API Key by visiting the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys).

## Social Logins (Github)

Social Logins are a great way to authenticate users in web applications. Remix SaaS provides a simple way to authenticate users with their Github account. We are using `remix-auth-github` to handle the authentication process.

- You can create a new OAuth App by visiting [Github Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) in order to get your `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` API Keys.

### Authenticate as Admin

You can authenticate as `admin` by using the following credentials:

- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Code: OTP Code is provided by the terminal/console, as email is not sent to the `admin` user.

The default admin email can be changed in the `/prisma/seed.ts` file.
