# Welcome to Remix SaaS Deployment Documentation

If you are new to Fly.io, please check the [Getting Started](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/) guide to have a better understanding of the platform.

## Stripe Webhook - Production

To get started, we'll require to get our Stripe Production Webhook API Key. This key will be required to set up the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` variable in our `.env` file.

1. Visit the [Stripe Webhook](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) section.
2. Create a new Webhook Endpoint.
3. Set the name of your future deployed app as the Webhook URL input. _(Check Notes)_
4. Select the latest Stripe API version from `API version` selector.
5. Select the following events to listen on: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`.
6. Add the Endpoint and reveal the `Signing Secret` value that has been provided from Stripe Webhook page.
7. Set this new secret as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT` variable into your `.env` file.

> **Note**
> Example of a Deployed Webhook Endpoint URL: https://deployed-app.fly.dev/api/webhook

Done! Now we can start receiving Stripe Events to your deployed app.

## Fly.io Deployment

Let's deploy our app!

1. [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)
2. Sign up or Log in into Fly:

```sh
fly auth signup
fly auth login
```

3. Launch your Fly app deployment:

```sh
fly launch
```

> [!NOTE]
> Everything is already set up for you, just follow the instructions provided by the CLI.
> Also, ensure that `template-name` from Fly CLI matches with the one from your `fly.toml` file.

4. After Fly CLI finishes the setup, we'll need to provide our `.env` variables as secrets. For that, fill in the following command with your environment variables:

```sh
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET="" ENCRYPTION_SECRET="" PROD_HOST_URL="https://my-app.fly.dev" RESEND_API_KEY="" STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="" STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="" STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT="" HONEYPOT_ENCRYPTION_SEED=""
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `PROD_HOST_URL` variable, requires the full name of your app, including `https` and `.fly.dev` domain. Example: `https://my-app.fly.dev`.

Some `.env` variables, like `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` has been skipped, in order to keep the deployment process as simple as possible.

5. After the first deployment, comment out the seed script from `docker-entrypoint.js` and run `fly deploy` again.

```ts
// Comment me out after the first deployment ‚ùó.
// await exec('npx prisma db seed')
```

```sh
fly deploy
```

6. Done! Visit your app at `https://my-app.fly.dev` üéâ!

## Additional Notes

- The deployment can also be handled by a CI/CD pipeline, but it's not covered in this documentation.
- If you have made any changes and want to redeploy the app, you can run `fly deploy` in your console.

## Done! üéâ
