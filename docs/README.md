## [Live Demo](https://remix-saas.fly.dev)

[![Remix SaaS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-xo/dev-xo/main/remix-saas/intro.png)](https://remix-saas.fly.dev)

We've created a simple demo that displays all template provided features. Psst! Give the site a few seconds to load! _(It's running on a free tier!)_

Here's a simple workflow you can follow to test the template:

1. Visit the [Live Demo](https://remix-saas.fly.dev).
2. Log In with your preferred authentication method.
3. Select a Subscription Plan and fill the Stripe Checkout inputs with its test values.

> [!NOTE]
> Stripe Test Mode uses the following number: `4242` as valid values for Card Information.
> Type it as much times as you can on each available input to successfully complete the Checkout step.

# Getting Started

Before starting our development or even deploying our template, we'll require to setup a few things _(not many, I promise!)_ in order to have a smooth experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remix SaaS is a Starter Kit that will help you to kickstart your next SaaS project. It's not a full-fledged SaaS application, but a foundation that you can build upon.

# Initialization

To get started, you can initialize the template into your workspace by running the following command:

```sh
npx create-remix-saas@latest

# Done! üéâ Please, continue reading the documentation!
```

# Environment

Remix SaaS requires a few environment variables to be set in order to work as expected. To keep it even simpler, on template initialization, some of these variables are already set for you.

Let's take a look at the required environment variables:

# Email

In order to send emails, we opted to use [Resend](https://resend.com/), a simple and easy-to-use email service for developers.

- You can get your API Key by visiting the [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys).

# Stripe

In order to use Stripe Subscriptions and seed our database, we'll require to get the secret keys from our Stripe Dashboard.

1. Create a [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) or use an existing one.
2. Visit [API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) section and copy the `Publishable` and `Secret` keys.
3. Paste each one of them into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` respectively.

## Stripe Webhook

In order to start receiving Stripe Events to our Webhook Endpoint, we'll require to install the [Stripe CLI.](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) Once installed run the following command in your console. _(Make sure you're in the root of your project)_:

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

This should give you a Webhook Secret Key. Copy and paste it into your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command should be running in your console while developing, especially when testing or handling Stripe Events.

# Database

Before starting our development, we'll require to setup our Prisma Migrations. Remix SaaS uses Prisma as its ORM, with SQLite as its default database. You can change it to any other database supported by Prisma.

To start our migrations, run the following command in your console:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init --skip-seed
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remix SaaS already comes with the initial migrations required to start the project. Use the above command to create new migrations or to reset your database.

## Seeding Database

Now that we have our migrations initialized, we'll require to seed it with our Stripe Plans. Check `/modules/stripe/plans` to learn more about it.

Once you're done, run the following command in your console:

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

> [!NOTE]
> Resetting our migrations will require us to clean our Stripe Data. You can do that by visiting your [Stripe Test Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers), scrolling down and clicking on `Delete all test data` button.

# Development Server

Now that we have everything configured, we can start our development server. Run the following command in your console:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should be able to access your app at üéâ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Deployment

Deployment and some other docs are available in the [Deployment](./09-deployment.md) section.
