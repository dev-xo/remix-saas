Would you like to change something? Fork it, change it and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`!<br/>
Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks).

## ‚ú® Quickstart

```sh
# Initialize the following template in your workspace:
npx create-remix --template dev-xo/stripe-stack

# Start dev server:
npm run dev
```

Done! This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## üëã Getting Started

This section will be splitted in three threads: **Live Demo | Development | Production**.

### Live Demo

Template's Demo has been developed to be really simple to use, being able to show all its provided features. Let's see the workflow to test it:

- Log In with your preferred Social.

  > Feel free to remove the authorized App after testing it.

- Select a Subscription Plan.

  > Besides you will see real money values from Stripe Checkout, don't worry, it's absolutely safe.

- Fill Stripe Checkout inputs with default development values.

  > Type `4242` as much times as you can on each available Input.

- Done! We should be redirected back to our App with newly Plan already set.
  <br />

### Development

Understanding our development workspace will keep us productive.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Folder Structure

A solid folder structure will help our App grow healthy over time. Let's review the most important folders.

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules         # Groups our App logic and splits it into smaller sections.
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ                 Stores related Components, Database interactions, Sessions, Utils etc.
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ                 This folder could also be called "lib", "services" etc.

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api           # Stores Stripe Webhook Endpoint file, and any realted API calls.
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources     # Used to call our own Server, do Redirects, update Sessions and so on.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Authentication Strategies

To provide Authentication to our App, we will need to get the API Keys from our Socials Providers.
Below here you can find all template's Providers OAuth Documentations.

- [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
- [Twitter OAuth](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/overview)
- [Github OAuth](https://docs.github.com/es/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps)
- [Discord OAuth](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

Once we got our Providers Keys `CLIENT and SECRET`, we can set them into `.env` file.

> If you are struggling on this step, feel free to contact me directly, have a look on youtube, or do a quick search on Google!.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Stripe Webhook

Let's see how we can start receiving Stripe Events to our Webhook Endpoint.

- Install [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

- Run the following command on the background:

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

The provided `Webhook Signing Secret` has to be set in our `.env` file as `DEV_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET`.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Stripe Products

From [Stripe Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) Dashboard, create as many products as you want. Remember to update their API Keys from `.env` file, as well as their descriptions and names from `/modules/stripe/utils/stripe-plans`.

### Production

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Stripe Webhook - Web Dashboard

Let's see how we can get and set our Production Webhook.

- Visit [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) Section into your Stripe Dashboard.

> The link provided to Webhooks its from Stripe Test Mode. Feel free to complete the "Activate Payments" steps to get a production Webhook Key.

- Create a new Webhook Endpoint.

- Set your deployed App Webhook Endpoint URL into `Endpoint URL` input.

> For this template was: https://stripe-stack.fly.dev/api/webhook

- Reveal the `Signing secret` that has been provided on your newly Webhook page and set it as `PROD_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET` in our `.env` file.

> Done! Give it a try. If something went wrong, verify that the provided steps has been followed correctly.

## üöÄ Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly:

```sh
fly auth signup
```

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

```sh
fly apps create stripe-stack
fly apps create stripe-stack-staging
```

> Make sure this name matches the `app` set in your `fly.toml` file. Otherwise, you will not be able to deploy.

- Initialize Git:

```sh
git init
```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

```sh
git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
```

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

```sh
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app stripe-stack
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app stripe-stack-staging
```

> If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

```sh
fly volumes create data --size 1 --app stripe-stack
fly volumes create data --size 1 --app stripe-stack-staging
```

- Now that everything is set up you can **commit and push** your changes to your repo.

> Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Setting Up Production Envs

Here is a simple command we can use after deployment. Feel free to fill it with your App `.env` variables.

```sh
flyctl secrets set NODE_ENV=production PROD_HOST_URL= GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID= GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET= GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= TWITTER_CLIENT_ID= TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET= DISCORD_CLIENT_ID= DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET= STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY= STRIPE_SECRET_KEY= PLAN_1_PRICE_ID= PLAN_2_PRICE_ID= PLAN_3_PRICE_ID= PROD_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=
```

> Development variables has opted out from this command.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Connecting to your database

The sqlite database lives at `/data/sqlite.db` in your deployed application. You can connect to the live database by running `fly ssh console -C database-cli`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.<br/><br/>
Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests / build / etc.<br/>
Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## üíÖ Testing

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Cypress

We use Cypress for End-to-End tests. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.

Also feel free to update prettier settings from `.package-json` with your preferred configuration.
